# How to Generate Dynamic Navbar Menus Using Liquid Conditionals
As an experienced Shopify developer working at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), building dynamic and optimized store designs is part of my daily work. Whether it's enhancing navigation, product listings, or other key interfaces, my goal is always to craft solutions that are not only functional, but also provide the best possible experience for customers.

While static pages certainly have their place, for many aspects of an evolving ecommerce store, static text and menus simply won't cut it. As product selections, collections, and other content areas shift regularly, these rigid designs leave much to be desired. That's why whenever dynamic data needs to drive an interface, I always strive to employ the power of Liquid templating.

Gone are the days of manually reordering endless lists of links or duplicating footer menus across hundreds of template files. By tapping into Liquid's robust conditional logic and iteration abilities, I can build fully customizable components that populate automatically based on existing content. Rather than force editors to maintain redundant information, these dynamic designs cut down on errors by pulling directly from a single source of truth.

One area that particularly benefits from this approach is site navigation. Out of all the primer interfaces, responsive and intuitive navbars frequently make or break the browsing experience. So lets get started already

## Laying the Foundation for Dynamic Navigation

Our goal is to generate menus that automatically evolve with content changes over time. To do so, we first need to construct the underlying framework.

Within a new Liquid template called `navbar.liquid`, we'll assemble some core pieces:

```liquid
<nav id="navbar">
  <ul>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

This sets up an outer `<nav>` container and nested unordered list `<ul>` - the core structural elements. Though blank for now, these handles allow slots for dynamically populated links.

But where will those links originate? Likely top-level sections like "Products" or "About". Instead of hardcoding constants, Shopify's data API surfaces live section objects.

To access this backend source and fuel our evolving menus, we include:

```liquid  
{% raw %}
{% include 'sections' %}
{% endraw %}
```

Now our framework can source foundational building blocks - sections ready to snap into place.

At this stage, we've constructed the basic supports and plumbing. In the next step, we'll build a loop to transport these definitional pieces precisely onto our template scaffolding. Links will materialize, automatically matching content changes below.  

For now, we've established the preliminary groundwork to foster dexterous navigation always synced to backend adjustments. The dynamic assembly begins!


## Get Navbar Data from Sections

Now that we've laid the foundation, it's time to populate our empty navbar with dynamic content. We'll query the global sections and loop through them to generate the menu links.

Within the `navbar.liquid` template, let's add the code below the empty `<ul>` element:

```liquid
{% for section in sections %}
  
  <li>
    <a href="{{ section.url }}">
      {{ section.title }}
    </a>
  </li>

{% endfor %}
```

This `for` loop iterates through each `section` within the `sections` collection we included earlier. 

On each iteration, it will output a `<li>` list item containing an `<a>` anchor link. The `href` attribute of the anchor is set to the `url` property of the current section. This ensures each link goes to the correct page.

The inner text of the anchor is dynamically output using `{{ section.title }}`. This displays the friendly title of each section, like "Home" or "About Us".

Once the loop finishes, we will have a full unordered list of links directly mirroring the global sections in the Shopify admin. No more manual copying and pasting of menu items!

It's important to note that any additions, removals, or reorders of sections made in the admin will now automatically propagate to the site navigation. We've created a fully dynamic component that adheres to content changes below.

Let's take a look at how this comes together in the browser.



## Dynamic Navigation

It's time to animate our navigation menu with living links drawn straight from Shopify's section data. Inside the loop, inject:

```liquid 
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}">
    {{ section.title }}
  </a>
</li>
```

On each iteration, this brings a new menu item to life. An anchor sparks to functionality equipped with:

- `section.url` as its command center, routing users accurately
- `section.title` as its branded label

Proper terminations complete the sequence. 

Now any additions, moves or changes below reanimate the frontend instantly. Sections breathe freely in and out of the menu.

Let's inspect the activated navigation in performance preview mode. The links spring to motion with each backend variation. 

Refresh to witness a fluently living, dynamically dancing menu in its element. Our navigation comes to vibrant life!


## Add Conditionals for Active Links

We can apply conditional logic to highlight the active navigation link. Wrap the link code in an `if` statement:

```liquid
{% if section.id == page.section.id %}
``` 

This checks if the section ID matches the ID of the currently-active section stored in `page.section`.

And add a class for styling:

```liquid
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}" class="active">
     {{ section.title }}
  </a>
</li>
```

Don't forget the closing `{% endif %}`:

```liquid
{% endif %} 
```

Now the matching link will receive an `active` class to visually distinguish it from the rest on every page load.


## Ensuring Proper Semantic Structure for an Accessible Navigation

For the dynamically generated site navigation to be comprehensible to all users, including those relying on assistive technologies, it is paramount that we produce semantically valid HTML.

Upon finishing each pass through our navigation item loop, we must appropriately close the surrounding unordered list element:

```liquid
</ul>
```

Similarly, we should terminate each nested list item at the end of its iteration:  

```liquid
  </li>
```

By rendering the full navigation markup like so:

```liquid
<nav>
  <ul>

   {% for section in sections %}

     <li>

     </li>

   {% endfor %}

  </ul>  
</nav>
```

We clearly define the parent-child relationship between list and elements in a way that adheres to semantic standards.

This ensures screen readers and other assistive tools can properly expose the navigation structure to all users. 

Let's review to confirm our work produces markup that is comprehensible and operable for people of all abilities. Semantic accuracy is key for an inclusive experience.


## Include Navbar in Layout

To incorporate the navigation bar across our site, we want to add it to the template layout file.

Use an `h2` tag to identify the next step:

### Insert `{{ 'navbar' | liquid }}` into header 

We can output the navbar HTML by inserting the following liquid tag into our main layout template header:

```liquid
{{ 'navbar' | liquid }}
```

This will render the navbar snippet we created.

### View updated navbar on live site

Now when previewing or visiting our live pages, the dynamically generated navigation should be included on every page layout.

Let's refresh a page to see the navbar in action, rendering at the top for a unified header experience. Our work is paid off with a fully functional, accessible navigation system!


## Conclusion
In conclusion, implementing a dynamic navigation menu powered by Liquid conditionals and section data provides many benefits for a Shopify store. Editors no longer need to manually update multiple pages when sections change, reducing errors and saving time. The navbar also automatically adapts as the site evolves. This dynamic approach improves the customer experience by ensuring intuitive navigation is always up-to-date.

While this example covers common use cases, additional customizations could make the navbar even more flexible and optimized. Navbar items and active states could be filtered based on custom collections. Dynamic dropdowns or flyouts could be added to accommodate deep site hierarchies. Interactive elements like cart indicators or search could also be integrated.
